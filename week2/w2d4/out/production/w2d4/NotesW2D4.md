# Notes W3D4

---

 - *Meta Note: Spellcheck can be a distance program*
 - *Meta Note: Do test cases - is it satisfied in all currently known conditions*

### Object Oriented Programming

---

- OOP is used for modeling real-world problems (objects, relations, interactions between objects, and how data flows)
- Clases: Blueprint for an object = user-defined data type
- Objects: Have mass and occupy space (objects begin at memory allocation of the class)

---

### Getters and Setters

- Getters get object data
- Setters set object data
- Dot notation is somewhat of a common getter
- Kotlin has built-in getters and setters

---

### Visibility Modifiers

- **Public** = Visible **Everywhere** - this is the default behavior
- **Private** = Visible only within the **current Class**
- **Protected** = Visible within the **same Class** and **Subclasses**
- **Internal** = Visible within the same **package/folder/module** 

---

### Recursion

---

- A function that calls itself
- Stack
- Backtracking
- Data trees are like objects that have a series of nested objects

> `fun recurring()
 { recurring() }
// some exit condition
`
- This function calls itself until there is an exit condition met
