//Quality Code
        //1. Coding Standards ( space, UPPERCASE, camelCase, TitleCase, )
        //2. Doc on top of every file 
        //3. //on top of every function one liner explaining what it is
        //4. Exceptions Handling

        //6. Clean Architecture -- adheres to a design pattern which is MVVM in our case
        //7. Write Unit Tests and make sure atleast you have 70% coverage 
        //8. Remove all println in prod app
        //9. Do not log or print sensitive information
