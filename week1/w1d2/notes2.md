- **Objects** are instances born of classes which are essentially blueprints. For example, a class of Bicycle can create various bike objects such as Mountain Bike, Fixed Gear Bike, etc.

Memory (pass-by-reference)

- **private** is an access modifier that restricts the methods and data to the class it's declared in
- **protected** is an access modifier that allows for subclasses to access methods and data from the superclass only
- **default** access modifier restricts the access to the current package

Packages
