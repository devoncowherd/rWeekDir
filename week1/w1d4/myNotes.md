Linked List:

1. linkedlist add at index 
2. linked list contains 
3. linked list .equals(another linked list)
4. contains returns true/false if the LL contains a certain value
    
>caveat: using == on objects doesn't work! 
why? == actually just compares memory references 
with objects... you have to implement .equals in 
whatever object you're comparing..luckily, 
because the original object class contains .
equals, even generics can use it even when 
generics usually can't use object specific 
methods (unless you're using interfaces)
