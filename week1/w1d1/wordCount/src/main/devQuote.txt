To stick with the basketball metaphor, you don't miss one-hundred percent of the shots you don't take; 
They're simply not taken. In other words, shots ",not taken," are best measured as potential. 
However, you do continue to approach an infinite number of potential success or failure shots whenever you don't take the shot. 
If you took n number of shots in your life, you can subtract the negatives (misses) and positives (successes).
This will give you something around infinite potential shots minus n if you're like most people and still alive.
If you look at it that way, every shot decreases your potential!
